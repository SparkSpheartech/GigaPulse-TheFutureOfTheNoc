# GigaPulse-TheFutureOfTheNoc

Linked below is a video of me talking about the technical aspects of this project Enjoy: https://youtu.be/CIcEHNrM57k

## Project Overview
GigaPulse is a next-generation Network Operations Center (NOC) automation platform designed to transition IT operations from reactive monitoring to proactive, AI-driven resolution. Built with **Python (FastAPI)** and **real-time WebSockets**, it features a suite of autonomous AI agents—**Diagnostic**, **Sentiment**, and **Topology**—that work in harmony to detect irregularities, prioritize critical alerts, and visualize network health solely through data.

### Key Features
- **AI-Driven Diagnostics**: Autonomous agents that predict and troubleshoot network issues before they impact services.
- **Real-Time Sentinel**: precise, live monitoring of network health using high-performance WebSockets.
- **Intelligent Triage**: A Sentiment Agent that analyzes alert urgency to prioritize critical incidents for human engineers.
- **Unified Dashboard**: A streamlined, modern interface that replaces legacy tool sprawl with a single pane of glass.

## Why I Built It
I built GigaPulse to demonstrate the "Future of the NOC." Traditional NOCs are often overwhelmed by alert fatigue and disjointed legacy systems like BMC Helix. I wanted to prove that by leveraging AI agents for improving the "Mean Time To Resolution" (MTTR), we can create a "Self-Driving NOC" that handles complex workflows autonomously. This project bridges the gap between legacy infrastructure and modern enterprise solutions like ServiceNow and Databricks, showcasing how an intelligent operations platform can free up engineers to focus on high-value innovation rather than firefighting.
